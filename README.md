# NoSQL-Weather-Database

# NoSQL Weather Database

A flexible, scalable weather data storage solution using NoSQL technologies. This project provides a backend system for ingesting, storing, and querying weather data, suitable for use in analytics, reporting, or powering weather-driven applications.

## Features

- **NoSQL Backend:** Utilizes NoSQL for high scalability and flexible schema design.
- **Weather Data Ingestion:** Supports importing weather data from various sources/formats.
- **Efficient Querying:** Fast queries for historical and real-time weather information.
- **Extensible Schema:** Easily adapt to new types of weather data or sensor inputs.
- **API Access:** Exposes RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations and data retrieval.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) or Python (choose based on your implementation)
- NoSQL database (MongoDB recommended, but can be adapted to other NoSQL systems)
- (Optional) Docker for containerized development

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/15athompson/NoSQL-Weather-Database.git
    cd NoSQL-Weather-Database
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    - For Node.js:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    - For Python:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

3. **Configure your database:**
    - Update your database connection string in `config.js` or `config.py`.

4. **Run the application:**
    - Node.js:
        ```bash
        npm start
        ```
    - Python:
        ```bash
        python app.py
        ```

## Usage

- **Store Weather Data:** Use API endpoints or ingestion scripts to add data.
- **Query Data:** Retrieve weather records by date, location, or other criteria.
- **Analytics:** Build dashboards or reports using the flexible query capabilities.

## API Endpoints

_(Sample structure, update with actual endpoints)_

- `GET /weather` – List all weather records
- `POST /weather` – Ingest new weather record
- `GET /weather/:id` – Get weather by record ID
- `GET /weather?date=YYYY-MM-DD` – Filter by date
- `GET /weather?location=CityName` – Filter by location

## Data Model

The database schema is flexible but typically includes:

- `timestamp` (Date/time of measurement)
- `location` (City, region, coordinates)
- `temperature`
- `humidity`
- `wind_speed`
- Additional fields as needed (precipitation, pressure, etc.)

## Extending

- Add support for new sensors or data sources.
- Integrate other NoSQL databases (Cassandra, DynamoDB, etc.).
- Enhance analytics or visualization modules.
